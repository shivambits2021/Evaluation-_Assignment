The initial code had issues with:

Incorrect overlap detection: The original code was not checking overlaps correctly, which could lead to incorrect event insertions, binary tree traversal, the conditions for inserting events into the left or right subtrees were reversed, leading to events being placed in the wrong position, also the edge case handling: The system did not properly handle back to back events.

# After making these changes, I tested the code using the following test cases:
# Test cases
calendar.book(5, 10)  # True (First event added)
calendar.book(8, 13)  # False (Overlaps with [5, 10))
calendar.book(10, 15) # True (Back-to-back scheduling is allowed)
calendar.book(2, 5)   # True (Fits before [5, 10))
calendar.book(3, 7)   # False (Overlaps with [5, 10))
